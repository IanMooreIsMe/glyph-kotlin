Hi, I'm **%s**, an experimental Discord bot created by %s.

I use **machine learning** to process **natural language** requests you give to me to the best of my current trained
ability.

To see what I can do, be sure to check out my **full skills list** and **suggest new ones** you'd like to see, in the
official server or via the anonymous feedback skill.
