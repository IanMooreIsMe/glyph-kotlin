Configuration
=============

Glyph makes it easy to set a custom configuration on your server.

Setting a configuration
------------------------
1. Say to Glyph "edit config"
2. Open the given link
3. Edit the configuration and click Save

  .. note::
    If the configuration has an error, Glyph will fallback to using the previous error-free configuration.
    Additionally, if Glyph is removed from the server, the server's configuration will be deleted from the database.
