The Kotlin rewrite of the Glyph Discord bot

Glyph is an experimental Discord bot that makes use of [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) to attempt to understand and process natural language requests as opposed to a traditional command based bot.

To learn more about how to use Glyph, check out the documentation [here](https://glyph-discord.readthedocs.io/en/latest/welcome.html).

## Self Hosting

In order to host your own copy of Glyph, some set up will be required. 
This will be further documented in detail later, but the basic idea is that you will need to create and train an agent on DialogFlow to respond to different prompts, and set all the needed environmental variables used in the code.
